To Do: change the directory in test_request.py to the directory where sample files are downloaded from https://webhose.io/free-datasets/technology-news-articles/

Used spacy in built pipeline to get noun chunks and then used tfidf to score the chunks.
Therefore no model folder is there.

### Steps to run
1. Open command prompt and move to the directory where server.py is saved and run "python server.py"
2. Open another command prompt and move to the directory where test_request.py is saved and run "python test_request.py"
3. Ouput will be returned on request comand prompt
